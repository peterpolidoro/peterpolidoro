## Peter Polidoro

I build robotics and automate experiments for the scientists studying animal
brains at Janelia Research Campus. Examples of these experiments include odor,
alcohol, visual, and audio assays for fruit flies, camera tracking systems for
zebrafish and larvae, haptic feedback joysticks for mice, and automated sensor
and actuator stations for rats.

I write software and embedded firmware, design and assemble circuit boards and
electrical systems, build distributed systems of networked electromechanical
devices and sensors, and support and maintain experimental rigs and firmware
libraries for a variety of users over years of service.

I enjoy blurring the lines between hardware and software, engineering and
science, practice and theory, high-level system architecture and low-level
component details.

I use free and open software and hardware whenever possible and encourage others
to do the same. Some of my favorite free software includes Emacs, Guix, Debian,
KiCAD, and FreeCAD.
